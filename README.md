Now that out of the way then we can start the fun part.

## ü™Ñ Installation
1. Download the zip from the latest release
2. Unzip it from any of the Unzipping Programs
3. Open `Terminal (Admin)` by right clicking on start button
4. Run this command.

> This is a Powershell script that is not digitally signed so you need to run some commands.

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Then `cd path` 
> remove the "path" with the actual path of the folder. <br>
> Eg - `cd C:\WinForge`

```
.\WinForge-OptionalSetup.ps1
```
5. I have also provided some files for Chris Titus Utlity & Winhance. That you can import in those apps and make the process more streamlined. All the `Import Files` are labeled.

And you're done. The script will ask you questions of what you wanna do?[^1]

[^1]: The default is set to NO.
