# ‚öôÔ∏è How WinForge Works

The script is designed to minimize user interaction while maximizing customization. It provides interactive prompts for each optional step and includes custom import files for GUI programs to streamline setup.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This script offers to uninstall Microsoft Edge via the Winhance Tool. If you don't want Edge removed, deselect the option in the Winhance screen.

    - IPv6: `2a10:50c0::ad1:ff`, `2a10:50c0::ad2:ff`
  - **Fastest (Cloudflare):** Maximum speed and low latency
    - IPv4: `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`
